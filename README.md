Portfolio
Description
This is an important to me as a person. It will show the advancements of my skills as I grow thru the bootcamp. So far I have made the basic outine for my Portfolio concentrating on CSS and specifically the hover function. As my career advances I will be able to modify and change this template to its finished product. Indirectly this Portfolio will be my progress report thru the Bootcamp that I am attending. Please let ne know if you have any suggestions for improvements, the moment we stop learning is the moment we halt progress.
